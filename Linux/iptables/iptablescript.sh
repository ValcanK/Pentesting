# This script will be used to modify the iptables of a linux system
# It will have a few options:
#	1. Block all non-service connections(example: 20,21,22,80,443,8080,etc...).
#	2. Block a specific IP.
#	3. Blocks currenlty connected IPs minus yours (will prompt you).
#	4. The ability to remove a block by IP or Range.
#	5. The ability to remove all blocks.
